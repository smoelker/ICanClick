ICanClick
=========
ICanClick is a tool that performs mouse clicks for you in case you can't operate a mouse yourself (because of rheumatism or osteoarthritis for example). To use the tool you need to be able to move the cursor eighther with a mouse or an other input device.

#How does it work?
When ICanClick is launched it will automatically start performing left mousebutton clicks everytime you stop moving the cursor for longer than 750ms. Also, a small tool window is opened in the left bottom of your screen. So, the default is left mouse click and on the tool window you can select the next mousebutton click that will be performed after which the next click will be reset to the default (left mousebutton).

#System requirements
- Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 or higher.
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 or higher.
